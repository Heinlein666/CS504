Since the 1980s, information technology has developed rapidly. Today, information technology is used in various fields and has greatly changed people's lifestyles. Online shopping is the product of the combination of information technology and retail. Online shopping has changed people's consumption patterns and behaviors. Compared with traditional consumers, online shopping consumers have many special behaviors. As the scale of online shopping continues to grow, it is necessary to study the characteristics of online shopping consumers. This article explains the behavioral characteristics of online shopping consumers, including impulsive consumption, price sensitivity, and word-of-mouth effect.










-Introduction
When you want to buy merchandise, where would be your first choice?  Would it be grocery, convenience stores, clothing stores, bakeries, fruit shops or other places? There is a new and increasingly popular way of shopping, online shopping. Different from traditional shopping methods, online shopping is a derivative of the development of Internet technology. As a new consumption method, online shopping has many advantages. For example, you can easily and quickly purchase goods from all over the world without leaving home. Generally, the manufactured product is delivered from online seller to client conveniently and quickly. You can get your goods usually within two days and you can track your packages (Eadicicco, 2017). It is amazing that you can stay at home and buy products from around the world, but technology is a double-edged sword.
Compared with traditional shopping methods, online shopping also has many shortcomings. For example, consumers cannot judge the quality of goods because they cannot touch and observe items in the real world before they buy it. Also, sometimes you can’t get your packages on time or your packages are lost. In addition, when you need customer service after purchasing an item, it could be difficult to get in touch with an onlineseller (Spring, 2006). However, with the rise and development of large e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba, these problems are being solved. Therefore, facing these circumstances, an online shopping consumer exhibits certain behaviors which are different from the traditional shopping consumer. People can experience its convenience, but they also take risks with online shopping. So, the consumer behavior of online shopping has its own characteristics. Compared with traditional shoppers, online shopping consumers are prone to impulse buying and price sensitivity, which means that there is more concern about price fluctuation and finally, they are more inclined to purchase by word of mouth[The thesis is OK, but a bit wordy.  Can you reduce the number of words in this sentence without changing the meaning?].
-Body
With the advancement of technology, retail methods are constantly changing. A dynamic retail strategy[What does a dynamic retail strategy mean?  What does it refer to?] is very important. Over the past decade, total U.S. retail sales have been increasing and the proportion of e-commerce has also been expanding. Figure 1 shows the percentage of e-commerce in US retail sales over the past decade. It is evident that in the past ten years, the proportion of e-commerce has fluctuated with the seasons and the overall trend has increased. Online shopping is becoming more important as a part of e-commerce, so it is becoming  more necessary to analyze the behavior of online shopping consumers (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020).
There is no Figure 1.  Where is it?

1.Online shopping consumers are prone to impulse buying.
Impulse buying is a sudden, unconsidered consumption behavior that is often spontaneous. It doesn’t include buying essential everyday items (Beatty & Ferrell, 1998). Both online shopping and traditional shopping have impulse shopping behavior. Discounts[citation?] and bonus packages are the most common reasons for impulse consumption.
A study of Chinese college students showed that discount and bonus packages have different effects on online consumption or physical shopping venues. When shopping online, discounts lead to more impulsive spending. That is, compared, for example, with gifts, discounts cause online consumers to have a stronger willingness to spend. For consumers that shop in the traditional way, compared with discounts, bonus packages have more power to influence the consumers’ willingness to consume and, therefore, cause more impulse consumption (Xu & Huang, 2014). From Figure 1[where is Figure 1?], it can be seen that in the third and fourth quarters of each year, the proportion of retail sales of e-commerce will rise within a short period of time and after the third and fourth quarter it will fall rapidly because the third and fourth quarters are the traditional shopping promotion seasons in the United States. Store discounts appeal to the consumer and lead to more impulse consumption of online shopping consumers. So, the proportion of e-commerce is constantly on the rise during the promotion season, and it drastically falls after the promotion season. Overall, consumers who shop online are more likely to buy impulsively[I'm not certan that you have proved your point about online shoppers being more impulsive.  It appears that certain universal factors cause impulse buying, whether in person or on line.].
In addition to discounts, are there other factors that cause online consumers to buy impulsively? In the traditional shopping method, when a customer arrives at the store, a salesperson will recommend a product to the customer. The praise of shop assistants often arouses consumers' impulse consumption. For example, this dress is really suitable for you, this product has a lot of points. Although online shopping does not have the salesperson and the praise of the salesperson, online merchants will send advertisements to consumers of what they desire, not what they need because they have your purchasing history which are important reasons for impulse consumption(Carter, Donovan & Jalleh, 2011). Precisely pushing the products that consumers are interested in can more easily cause consumers to purchase. The gorgeous web design and advertisements better show the advantages of the product. It is these technologies that continue to promote the development of online shopping (Song & Agnes, 2019).
The third reason that causes consumers to make impulse purchases is the variety of products (Beatty & Ferrell, 1998). You can buy goods from all over the world when you shop online. The variety of online shopping products is greater than that of grocery stores, causing online shopping consumers to have a stronger tendency to impulse consumption[Do you have any additional facts or research to support this point?  It is a very thin paragraph.].
It is for these reasons that consumers who shop online are more prone to impulse buying.c
2.Online shopping consumer are more price sensitivity.
Consumers who shop online have a lower opportunity cost to buy cheap goods. When an option is chosen from alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the best alternative choice (Will, 2019). Finding cheaper goods takes time and takes up time for consumers to work and play. This is the opportunity cost for the consumer[The beginning of this paragraph is a bit confusing.  Can you please rewrite and clarify?]. The search and price sorting functions of online shopping make it very easy for online shoppers to find the cheapest products. For consumers in the traditional way, it is impossible to buy paper in the city next door although the paper in the city next door is cheaper. The opportunity cost is too high. So, compared to consumers who traditionally go to the grocery store to buy goods, consumers who shop online are very price sensitive because they can easily find the cheapest one. In addition, for food and FMCG[What are FMCG items?  Define a term the first time you use it] items, online shopping is cheaper than grocery stores（Consumer Reports. Jul2015, Vol. 80 Issue 7）. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are products that are sold quickly and at a relatively low cost.
From the greater impact of discounts on online consumers, we can also see that consumers who shop online are more sensitive to product prices. So the best strategy for online promotion is cheaper prices[Are there other "best" strategies or is this the only one?].
3.Word of mouth is more important for online shopping.
Word of mouth is the passing of information from person to person. Compared with the traditional consumer word-of-mouth effect, it has a greater impact on consumers who shop online[citation needed]. For traditional consumers, they can touch, see, and smell the products they want to buy, and for them, what you see is what you get. So，word of mouth has a limited effect on traditional consumers. Because regardless of the word of mouth effect of a product, every consumer who goes to the grocery store will evaluate the product again and it is difficult for consumers to know what other customers think of the product[citation needed].  However for online shopping, consumers cannot see the products they want to buy, they can only see advertisements. All[Is this true for all consumeers?] consumers know that advertising has an exaggerated component, which is somewhat deceptive and misleading, but for customers who shop online, they can easily see what other customers think of the product (Consumer Reports, 2019). So, word-of-mouth effect is very important for consumers who shop online, so that they can get a relatively true evaluation of the product through the evaluation of other customers. Therefore, every electronic shopping platform now has a module for customer evaluation and feedback to increase customer confidence in purchasing products (Najmi et al., 2015).
However, in recent years, customer evaluations have become less reliable. Consumers do not know whether these customer evaluations are real customer evaluations[Can you explain further?] (Spring, 2006). Perhaps these evaluations are just another type of advertising for the store. Those positive customer evaluations may be a way for the store to cheat customers way. Therefore, the word-of-mouth effect of online shopping is weakening[Is there data to support this statement?], and now consumers who shop online will be more optimistic about after-sales guarantees.
-Conclusion
There are three characteristics for consumers who shop online, they are more prone to impulse consumption, more price sensitive, and more concerned about word of mouth[Try to paraphrase your thesis in the conclusion, not repeat the same words you used in the thesis]. As the proportion of online shopping in retail sales continues to expand, retail and sales strategies need to be changed. It is becoming increasingly important to consider the special consumer behavior of online shopping consumers. For sellers, when formulating sales strategies, they need to fully recognize the importance of online sales platforms and formulate reasonable sales strategies. Sellers can be combined with physical stores and online platforms, and fully consider the behavior characteristics of online shopping consumers and traditional consumers to conduct differentiated marketing. Of course, the world is constantly changing. As the process of globalization continues to accelerate, online shopping needs to adapt to globalization. This is a challenge and an opportunity for online platform sellers.
